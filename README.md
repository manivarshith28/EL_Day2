This task involes in creating a table (for example : CRICKETERS), inserting values into it, updating and deleting few records.

In this task we also took care of NULL values especially in the field of jersy_no(see table : CRICKETERS).

I have also uploaded output_images after executing few queries. 

In order to fully understand output_images, please follow the below mentioned order while executing sql queries: 
1. Creation
2. Insertion
3. Updation
4. Deletion
